# geffenlab-synthesis
Synthesize neural and behavioral data into dataframes and summary plots.

This container incorporates code from the lab's non-private population-analysis repo:

https://github.com/jcollina/population-analysis.git

To simplify the Docker build, we obtain this repo as a git submodule in code/population-analysis.
To get all the latest code, you can pull with submodules.

```
git pull --recurse-submodules
```
